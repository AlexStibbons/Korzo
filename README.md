# Korzo

A CRUD film database in which each film is described by its title, year of release, whether it's a national or an international production, its list of genres and where it's stored (as in: Film 'A' is stored in 'ExternalDrive A-F').


## Korzo

A web-app serving as a prototype for, ultimately, a standalone desktop app. This folder contains a backend + frontend built with Java Spring Boot and Angular (same stack used for [reddiu](https://github.com/AlexStibbons/reddiu)). 

etc.
